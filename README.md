# CitySDK API Node Wrapper

A node package based on the public API Library via http://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/

This fork adds 2015 data, as well as 1990-2010 data to the SDK.


## Super simple to use

The Node CitySDK Wrapper is designed to be the simplest way possible to make calls to the Census CitySDK API from a node-based project


## Changes to the original CitySDK

- Removal of jquery library (uses npm request module instead of $.ajax calls, replaces $.grep with _.filter(), replaces $.inArray with native .indexOf(), uses V8 Engine's native JSON.parse() etc)
- Replaced externally terraformer.io library with its corresponding node package https://github.com/Esri/Terraformer
- Restructed for server based operation instead of client-side (ie. made appropriate changes for instances of window.[])


## Getting Started

Install via NPM

`npm install git://github.com/chadhuber/citysdk-node.git`


Inside your Node.js project

`var census = require('citysdk')(YOUR_CENSUS_API_KEY);`

nb. Request your Census API Key at http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html


## Types of Requests

There are two basic types of requests, `apiRequest()` which retrieves data based on the location and variables 
you request and `geoRequest()` which will respond with the data in GEOJSON format including the bounding box 
coordinates data for creating maps

### Request Format

Both requests have the same basic format:

```js

census.apiRequest(request, callback);

census.geoRequest(request, callback);

```

__Arguments__

* `request` - The request object, see more on this below
* `callback(response)` - A callback which is called when the request is completed 
  with response object

## Request Object

__Location Options__

To specify a location, you must use `lat` and `lng`, or `zip`, or `state`. At least one of these must be specified.

* __lat__ [int] - The latitude of the requested location (North). Also supported: `latitude`, `y`
* __lng__ [int] - The longitude of the requested location (East). Also supported: `longitude`, `x`
* __zip__ [string] - The 5-digit zip code of the location. Note that USPS zip code areas do not align precisely with Census geographies, so when high accuracy is required it is recommended to use latitude and longitude. Specified as a string because certain zip codes begin with zeroes.
* __state__ [string] - The 2-letter USPS state code. It will be converted into the latitude and longitude of that state's capital.

__Level Options__

* __level__ [string] - At what level to request the data. These are based on census geographies. Supported options are: `blockGroup`, `tract`, `county`, `state`, `us`, and `place`. Note that the `place` tag currently only supports incorporated places.
* __sublevel__ [boolean] - _Optional_ Whether or not to return based upon sublevels (Defaults to `false`)
* __container__ [string] - _Optional_ GeoJSON request only - Specifies a level which serves as a boundary for a GeoJSON request. For instance, if your level is `tract` and your container is set as `place` with sublevel enabled, it will return all tracts which fall within or touch that place's geographical boundaries. Supported options are: `tract`, `county`, `state`, `place`, `geometry`, and `geometry_within`. Note that for the `geometry` and `geometry` within tags you must specify the containerGeometry. `geometry` will return any entities that intersect the given geometry (including if they intersect but extend beyond the perimeter) whereas `geometry_within` will only return entities that are entirely contained within the containerGeometry specified.
* __containerGeometry__ [object] - _Optional_ GeoJSON request only - Specifies the bounding geometry for a GeoJSON request. The format of this data should be ArcGIS ESRI JSON. You can convert GeoJSON into ESRI using the `GEOtoESRI()` function. The boundary can be any arbitrary closed region or regions.

__Data Options__

* __api__ [string] - _Optional_ Specifies the API to use. Supported options are: `acs1`, `acs3`, and `acs5`. (Defaults to `acs5`)
* __year__ [int] _Optional_ - Specifies the year of the API to use. Supported years per API vary, please see the acsyears object of the Census module for details (Defaults to `2014`).
* __variables__ [array] _Optional_ - An array of strings specifying which variables to query. One can specify an aliased variable (see variable aliases) or a specific ACS variable code (e.g. `B01003_001E`). If this array is not specified, the SDK will simply geocode the location into Census FIPS codes. A list of all ACS variables is available via the getACSVariableDictionary() function.

## Request Examples

A simple apiRequest()

```js

// latitude and longitude of Mark Twain's childhood home

var request = {
  "lat": 39.710438,
  "lng": -91.356049,
  "level": "blockGroup",
  "variables": [
      "income",
      "population"
  ]
};

census.apiRequest(request, function(response) {
  console.log(response);
});

```

This request will have the following response

```json

{ 
  "lat": 39.710438,
  "lng": -91.356049,
  "level": "blockGroup",
  "sublevel": false,
  "variables": [ "income", "population" ],
  "year": 2013,
  "api": "acs5",
  "state": "29",
  "county": "127",
  "tract": "960800",
  "blockGroup": "1",
  "place": "30214",
  "place_name": "Hannibal city",
  "data": [{ 
    "income": "28864",
    "population": "601"
  }] 
}

````


## Variable Aliases

These are simply the most interesting variables, use the function `getACSVariableDictionary()` 
for a complete listing (or see https://gist.github.com/chadhuber/e03d4a13e79700a40447 for its output as of 10/11/15)
